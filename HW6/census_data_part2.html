    <h2>Percent of the Population Attending College and in an Undergraduate Program</h2>
    <h4>This Chloropleth Map represents the percent of people attending college from each county of New York State. The map is categorized using a classification scheme of Natural Breaks to decide the numerical breaks between the differing colored tiles. This categorization style is good for depicting the clusters within the categories. This helps to distribute the data, and thus, represent it well on a Chloropleth. Because of this, the resulting splits between categories is unclear since it is dependent on how the data is spread out.</h4>

    </a><h2>Percent of Females Attending College or Graduate Programs in New York State</h2>
    <h4>This Chloropleth Map represents the percent of women attending college currnetly in New York and the amount each county has of women attending colleges against one another using an Equal Interval classification style. This style is easily understood by viewers because the categories of different colorizations on a Cholorpleth have simple intervals to interpret. The issue with working with this style is that the outliers shift the data and make it so the data is not distributed well on the map.</h4></a>

    <h4>This Chloropleth Map represents the percent of men attending college currnetly in New York and the amount each county has of men attending colleges against one another using a Quantile Classification style. This style puts all of the percentages of men attending university in order. This style classification splits up the data equally into the desired numer of categories.</h4></a>

    </a><h4>Other types of Classification Styles not Depicted:</h4></a>
    </a><h2>Standard Deviation: This classification is profficient in demonstrating how far values are straying from the mean value. Additionally, there are intervals that are very common to use with Standard Deviation, such as, one-half or one-third and thus there is consistency in the way these classification styles are displayed. </h2></a>
