    <h2>Population Attending College and in an Undergraduate Program</h2>
    <h4>This Chloropleth Map represents the amount of popele enrolled in an undergraduate program in their respective college that live in New York. Using a Natual Break Classification for determining the groups on the legend made it so most of the counties in New York fit into the lowest category group. This is most likely due to places like New York City, Long Island, and Buffalo having such high amount of people compared to the rest of the state.</h4>
